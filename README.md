# Wikicurricula

Interactive tool that helps visualize national curriculum data stored in Wikidata. It also shows metrics about Wikipedia articles that are relevant to the curriculum.

# ‚öôÔ∏è How to make a local installation of the Wikicurricula on your Computer

1. Install Git (if not already installed):
    If you haven't already installed Git on your computer, you can download and install it from the official Git website: <https://git-scm.com/downloads>

2. Open a Terminal or Command Prompt

3. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repo:
    ```
        $ cd /path/to/desired/directory
    ```

4. Clone the Repository:
    ```
        git clone https://github.com/wikicurricula-uy/wikicurricula-boilerplate.git
    ```

6. Navigate to the cloned repository:
    Use the cd command to move into the directory that was created by the git clone command: `cd repo-name`.
    ```
        cd wikicurricula-boilerplate
    ```

7. If not installed already, install in your computer Python3 and the SPARQLWrapper extension.  
    ```
        apt install python3
        sudo apt install python3-sparqlwrapper
    ```
      
8.  Navigate to the `data-gathering` folder in your terminal and fetch school curriculum data by running `bot.py` script which receives the Wikipedia language and the country's Wikidata QId number as parameters. This script calls the query.py script which fetches and processes information about a country's national curriculum from Wikidata and stores it in a CSV file.
    ```
        cd data-gathering
        python3 bot.py WIKIPEDIA_LANGUAGE_CODE WIKIDATA_COUNTRY_ID
    ```

    For example:
    ```
        # fetch data from the Wikipedia in Spanish with reference to the Uruguay's national curriculum
        python3 bot.py es 77
        # fetch data from the Wikipedia in English with reference to Ghana's national curriculum
        python3 bot.py en 117
        # fetch data from the Wikipedia in Twi with reference to Ghana's national curriculum
        python3 bot.py tw 117
        # fetch data from the Wikipedia in Italian with reference to Italy's curriculum
        python3 bot.py it 38
    ```

9. Run the translation script to generate the file that will be used for the visualizattion.
    ```
        python3 translate.py es 77
        # or
        python3 translate.py en 117
        # etc...
    ```

10. Check the visuals:

    -   You can go to your file explorer and under the directory you've just created by cloning the wikicurricula-boilerplate repository, descend into the "visualization", you will find an `index.html` file. Open this file with any browser of you choice
    -   If you are using a code editor like Visual Studio Code install the "live server" extension. After installation, right click on the `index.html` file in the visualization folder and select "open with Live erver" option. This will start a server port : 5500 and a new browser window should automatically open, displaying your index.html file. The Live Server extension will serve your HTML file on a local development server with live reloading, allowing you to see changes in real-time as you edit the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files associated with your project.

    This steps works for other visualization in the project.

    

# üìúHow to deploy Wikicurr√≠cula Boilerplate in Toolforge

Toolforge is simply a hosting environment for developers working on services that provide value to the Wikimedia movement. It provides web servers, data access, job management, and other features to help developers maintain tools and bots. It is a Free, reliable, and scalable cloud hosting for web services using PHP, Python, Node.js, Java, and other languages or frameworks.It also hosts continuous bots, and scheduled tasks. An example of a tool hosted on Toolforge is: `WikiTools`, a light tools for Wikipedia authors and `wordcount`, simple word counter built with Python.

## ‚ö°Ô∏èBasic Skill Requirements

-   Basic Knowledge of some programming knowledge
-   Basic Knowledge of Unix command line
-   Basic Knowledge of SSH (SSH client like Putty or WinSCP or Linux command line)

## ‚ö°Ô∏èAccounts Needed

A Toolforge account is required to get started. It is bascicaly creating a "Wikimedia developer account", and a "Wikimedia account".

1. `Wikimedia account`: Also known as `"Wikimedia single user login (SUL)" account`. It allows you to log into general wikis like Wikipedia, MediaWiki, and MetaWiki. Click here to create account. [Create Account](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:CreateAccount)

2. `a Wikimedia developer account`: for access to the Toolforge project. Click the link to register. [Create Account](https://idm.wikimedia.org/signup/) or you can create a developer account through the [Toolforge admin console](Toolsadmin) if you already have a wikimedia account. Follow this steps:
    - Goto `Toolforge admin console` <https://toolsadmin.wikimedia.org/> and follow this steps:
    - Click on `Get Started`
    - You will be taken to a Toolforge-admin-console login page. Click on the `sign Up` link.
    - On the "Create a Wikimedia developer account" page, press/click the `Login using Wikimedia account` button. Enter your Wikimedia account username and password.
    - Once you're logged in, you'll be directed back to Toolsadmin. There, you'll be guided through the process of setting up an LDAP username, a UNIX shell username, and a password. Additionally, you'll be asked to provide your email address and consent to the terms of service and code of conduct specific to technical spaces.
    - Submit the form to complete creating your Wikimedia developer account.

## ‚ö°Ô∏èSteps to deploy a tool or application(E.g Uruguay's Wikicurricula) to Toolforge

Now that you have the two(2) required accounts, follow the steps to deploy"

-   Go to the the [Toolforge admin console](https://toolsadmin.wikimedia.org/auth/login/) and log in using your LDAP username

-   Once you're logged in, Go to the settings page in Toolsadmin to link your Wikimedia and Phabricator accounts to Toolforge. You might not have a Phabricator account, create one following the directions provided on the registration page.

-   Create a new tool account / tool by clicking on the "Tools" tab to go to the tools page in Toolsadmin. If you're not a Toolforge member yet, start from step 1 but if you are, go to step 2

    1. Request Toolforge membership

    ```
    Submit a Toolforge membership request and wait for its approval.
    Your request will be reviewed, and you will receive confirmation within a week.
    You will be notified through your Wikitech user account.
    After you are added as a Toolforge member, log out and then log in again at toolsadmin.wikimedia.org.
    Doing this is required for your membership to take effect.

    ```

    After your Toolforge membership has been approved, create new tool accounts. Each individual bot, web service or other tool should have a tool account. 2. Click the "Create new tool" link at the bottom of the "Your tools" sidebar. Follow the instructions in the tool account creation form. Note the instructions below about Naming your tool. For example You can name the tool: "wikicurricula-uy" 3. After you create the tool account, log off, then log back in to access the new tool account.

-   Connect to Toolforge servers using SSH
    Currently, the only way to interact with Toolforge is through a command-line interface. If you prefer to develop using IDEs like Visual Studio Code or Eclipse, you can mount the home directory of your tool onto your local Linux machine or virtual machine (VM) Learn more at <https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Toolforge/Tool_Accounts>

    ### Set up an SSH client and a key

    -   Install an SSH client, if you do not have one already. Windows 10 (version 1803+) comes with OpenSSH built in. Popular clients include OpenSSH and PuTTY.
    -   Generate an SSH key. SSH uses public-key cryptography to securely authenticate you to the server. You can generate one by entering the following in the terminal.

    ```
        ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@youremail.com"
    ```

    Use the email you wish to associate with the SSH Key, and then press enter.
    When prompted Enter file in which to save the key, click enter to choose the default.
    Type a secure passphrase, and click enter.
    Retype the secure passphrase, and click enter.
    The terminal will display information about the files your identification and public key will be saved in:

    `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` - private key (as the name suggests, keep this private!)
    `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` - public key
    A fingerprint and randomart image for the key will be generated.

    -   Add your public SSH key to your developer account under the settings page of the Toolforge admin console. Copy the contents of `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` into the New SSH Key field and click Add SSH key.

-   Log in to Toolforge

    1. Use your SSH client or terminal or command prompt to connect to Toolforge through the login.toolforge.org bastion host. Remember to use the shell username you picked when creating your Wikimedia developer account. You can check your username at toolsadmin.

    ```
    $ ssh -i <path-to-ssh-private-key> <shell-username>@login.toolforge.org
    ```

    2. On your first connection, your SSH client will ask you to verify the "fingerprint" of the server. Ensure that the fingerprint shown matches ones shown on [Help:SSH Fingerprints](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:SSH_Fingerprints).
    3. After you connect, the command prompt displays your username and the internal name of the host to which you are connected:

    `<shell-username>@tools-sgebastion-10:~$`

-   From the command line, use the `become` command to switch to the tool account for the tool you want to work on:

    ```
    $ become <toolname>
    ```

    Where "toolname" is the name you chose when creating the tool. You should see the command prompt change to:

    `tools.<toolname>@tools-sgebastion-10:~$`

-   Serving static files
    In Toolforge, tools are typically created using programming languages like Python, Node.js, or other supported options. However, when it comes to hosting a static website, there's no need to develop a specialized tool. Instead, you can leverage the web space provided by Toolforge.

    To deploy the Wikicurr√≠cula Boilerplate on Toolforge, simply upload your files to the tool's `$HOME/www/static` directory. Once uploaded, your content will be accessible directly via the following URL: tools-static.wmflabs.org/toolname.

    No additional action is required on the tool's part‚Äîjust ensure your files are placed in the designated folder and set to be readable. It should all seamlessly 'just work'.

    After switching to the tool's account, execute the following commands to upload the files for the Wikicurr√≠cula Boilerplate into the $HOME/www/static directory of the 'wikicurricula-uy' space:

    ```
         mkdir -p $HOME/www/static
         cd $HOME/www/static
         git clone https://github.com/wikicurricula-uy/wikicurricula-boilerplate.git
    ```

A practice on migrating Uruguay's Wikicurricula from it's current hosting (Github Pages) to Toolforge was done and can be found at: <https://tools-static.wmflabs.org/wikicurricula-uy/wikicurricula-uy.github.io/index.html>




# üìúHow to Implement - and deploy at Toolforge - Wikicurricula for Ghana's national curriculum, with reference to the English Wikipedia

One of goals of Wikimedia is to enhance the educational experience of students by making sure that the information available on platforms like Wikicurricula corresponds to what students are studying in their classrooms, fostering a harmonious and supportive learning environment. To do so, Wikimedia stores schools' curricula data in a large database called Wikidata and then allows students, editors,teachers to interact with the data through an interface known as Wikicurricula.

This documentation details steps taken to implement and deploy Ghana's national curriculum to Toolforge. 

### Required Skills

Before proceeding, understand these:

-   [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Introduction)
-   [SPARQL](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_tutorial)
-   [Toolforge](https://github.com/wikicurricula-uy/wikicurricula-boilerplate#%EF%B8%8Faccounts-needed)

1. Code Setup: Create a new repository for your Wikicurricula project. Run:
```
    git clone https://github.com/wikicurricula-uy/wikicurricula-boilerplate.git
```

2. Instead of manually visiting the [Wikidata Query Service](https://query.wikidata.org/) to run a query that fetches a country's national curriculum from Wikidata and store it in CSV files as demonstrated in "How to feed the visualization with data from a new curriculum" section, the query.py script makes it easier. All you have to do is navigate to the "data-gathering" directory and run the bot.py script with the following two argument; "WIKIPEDIA_LANGUAGE_CODE" and "WIKIDATA_COUNTRY_ID"

```
    python bot.py <WIKIPEDIA_LANGUAGE_CODE> <WIKIDATA_COUNTRY_ID>

    #for Ghana
    python bot.py en 117
```
3. Run the translate.py script which prepares generated data from Wikipedia articles of Ghana and Uruguay for visualization, enabling analysis and insights using our visualization tool; WikiCurricula.

```
    python translate.py <WIKIPEDIA_LANGUAGE_CODE> <WIKIDATA_COUNTRY_ID>
    # for Ghana
    python translate.py en 117
    # This will create a "ghana_voci_2023.tsv" file under the visualization/assets/data folder.
```

4. Create a html file for visual display using the index.html file as template. The "data-country" in the htm file indicates a custom data attribute named data-country with the value `country's name`. It stores information about the country(country's name) as it will be used to determine the file that'll be used for the visulaization.

### Deploy the curricula on Toolforge

1. Use this guide to deploy the curricula to Toolforge. https://github.com/wikicurricula-uy/wikicurricula-boilerplate#how-to-deploy-wikicurr%C3%ADcula-boilerplate-in-toolforge
